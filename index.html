    <p>My name is Andrew Kunselman and I attended Central Valley High School where in Aliquippa Pennsylvania.  I graduated in 2015 and enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh where I am a current Senior, majoring in Marketing and Business Information Systems with a Certificate in Digital Media.  I am on track to graduate in April, 2019.    I have also received my Google AdWords Certification in my spare time and ran two successful political online advertising campaigns.  One was a state-wide race in Pennsylvania, and one was in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.</p> 
    <p> At Pitt, I landed a job as an Equipment Manager for the University of Pittsburgh Football team where I distribute and routinely fix helmets, shoulder pads, and other equipment.  As an Equipment Manager I am also responsible for pre-game and post-game locker room set up and clean up, including traveling to away games, and providing laundry service for members of the team and staff.  I am also involved in the American Marketing Association and their spin-off club Pitt Creative 360 which provides marketing content for other clubs on campus.</p>

    <h3>Website</h3>
	<p>The biggest project for me this semester was my website.  If it seems like my website is not very creative, there is a good reason for that.  I want to use it as a professional resource after this course is over.  I plan to remove most of the course-work written content and upload my own media and portfolio.  I will have the link on my LinkedIn page, as well as on my resume.  To look professional, I kept the gray and black color scheme with the splash of blue, since that is my favorite color.  The suit-and-tie headshot of me is also on there for the professional feel.</p>
	<p>I think I was referring to “parallax” scrolling incorrectly all semester, because in my research “parallax” plays with two different speeds while scrolling – the foreground scrolls at one speed while the background scrolls at another speed.  What I wanted to do was put all of the important content on one page and animate the scroll.  I was finally able to achieve this by copying and pasting <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll">cferdinandi’s</a> code from his GitHub page to mine and linking to the folder in my html.</p>
	<p>The reason I wanted the smooth scroll was really just to show off how much I could figure out about coding in one semester.  Even though I copied and pasted it, I still had to figure out how to add the id tags, change the href links, and link my html to the JavaScript code.  Coming into this class, I knew absolutely nothing about coding, so this final product is something I am very proud of.</p>
	<p>I knew from the beginning, however, if I was going to implement a smooth scroll on a lengthy page, I would need a sticky nav bar so that users can get back to the top, or to another section of the page easily from wherever they currently are.  To do this, I taught myself a little bit of JavaScript, using some step-by-step written instructions as well as a few YouTube videos.  I wasn’t able to figure out how to link to my JavaScript file, but I figured out how to wrap the code in script tags in my html.</p>
	<p>Once I figured out how to get the sticky navbar and have my links go to id’s on the page, I wanted the links in my nav bar to change color according to which section of the page you were on.  To do this, I implemented some more JavaScript to change the class of the link you click to “current” and remove the “current” class from every other link.  This, again, was done using YouTube and other websites to self-teach myself some JavaScript.  So just to recap, my sticky navbar and color-changing links are wrapped in script tags in the html, and the smooth scroll JavaScript is in a separate file that my html links to.</p>
	<p>The final thing I did to my nav bar was remove the “Presentation” link because all of the content from my PowerPoint presentation will be reflected in my Final Portfolio Showcase.  I did this to avoid being repetitive and also clear up some space in my nav bar.</p>
	<p>Overall, I think the final version of my website turned out much better than I had expected it to.  It’s exciting to see what you can produce just by using trial and error and testing your own limits.  Not only did I learn a lot about coding this semester, but I also learned a lot about the creative process and doing things differently than most others.  I believe I am the only one in the class that chose to put all of my content on one page.</p>
	<p>The only regret I have is that I didn’t have enough time to figure out how to display the sub-link’s content on the big page.  When a user clicks on a sub-menu link, it still takes them to a separate page, dedicated to that specific content.  I would like to figure this out in the near future for my personal use on my professional website.</p>
    <h3>Photoshop</h3>
	<p>The other thing I focused on all semester was Adobe Photoshop.  Being a Marketing major, I think Photoshop is an essential skill to set myself ahead of the competition.  There is a lot of discussion about the negative effects of Photoshop in print advertising on body image and self-confidence.  However, Photoshop and Illustrator can be used for other elements of marketing, such as Logo Design, which I spent a lot of time on this semester.  I have discussed it in previous posts, but I joined a club on campus called Pitt Creative 360 and was challenged with creating a logo for our own club, as well as a logo for the Rocketry Club here at Pitt.</p>
	<p>At the time, I only had experience with Photoshop from 10th grade in high school, and the in-class advertising edit we did.  I had to sort-of learn on the fly about things like the shape tool, rasterizing images, and all of the settings you can use inside of the text tool.  We were also on a timeline to give a proposed logo to the Rocketry Club, so I had to learn quickly.  Some of the logos I came up with were simply awful, and the Creative 360 team let me know about it.  I really like the constructive criticism they give though.  It forces me to think more deliberately before I create something.  The Feedback Loop provided by Creative 360 is much like the one discussed in <i>Writer/Designer</i>.  I would “share my project, receive feedback, make revisions, and move forward, then receive more feedback, continuing on until the stakeholders and I were satisfied.” (pg. 100).</p>
	<p>Even though the content I produced was denied, I still learned a lot about Photoshop in the process.  However, if I were to do it again, I would sketch my logos on paper first, and then create them on Photoshop.  I spent upwards of an hour per logo on Photoshop just to have it rejected right off the bat.  As Arola et al. stated in <i>Writer/Designer</i>, “A big part of designing is to experiment with ways of combining content and form.” (pg. 52). If I sketched my logos first, I could have come up with more and possibly better submissions.  This was a bit of a conundrum, because I wanted to create something that would be approved by the club, but I also wanted some practice in Photoshop.</p>
	<p>Sadly, the Rocketry Club stopped answering our emails after Spring Break, so I will never know if my final proposed logo was liked or disliked.  I’m glad I got some experience in Photoshop and working with clients though, because that is something I would like to do as a career in the future.</p>
	<p>Another feature I learned to use in Photoshop is Smart Objects.  These are also great for working with clients, because they allow you to show them how advertisements will look in a real-life scenario, rather than flat on a screen.  I took a picture of a blank billboard on a highway, imposed a Smart Object over the billboard, and edited the smart object in another tab.  Every time I would save my changes to the Smart Object, they would reflect on the billboard picture, adjusted for the angle of the billboard.  This is great because if a client wants an ad on a billboard over PA 376, I could go out and get a picture of the exact billboard, and then show them how their ad would look in that exact location!</p>
	<p>My Photoshop skills have come a long way in a short amount of time, and I hope to expand upon them in the future through Creative 360.  I am also lucky enough to work in the same building as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zachlantz/">Zach Lantz</a>, who is one of the best graphic designers in Power 5 Athletics.  I plan to shadow him for a few days in the near future and pick up some tips that I can apply to my own work.</p>
