    <p>My name is Andrew Kunselman and I attended Central Valley High School where in Aliquippa Pennsylvania.  I graduated in 2015 and enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh where I am a current Senior, majoring in Marketing and Business Information Systems with a Certificate in Digital Media.  I am on track to graduate in April, 2019.    I have also received my Google AdWords Certification in my spare time and ran two successful political online advertising campaigns.  One was a state-wide race in Pennsylvania, and one was in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.</p> 
    <p> At Pitt, I landed a job as an Equipment Manager for the University of Pittsburgh Football team where I distribute and routinely fix helmets, shoulder pads, and other equipment.  As an Equipment Manager I am also responsible for pre-game and post-game locker room set up and clean up, including traveling to away games, and providing laundry service for members of the team and staff.  I am also involved in the American Marketing Association and their spin-off club Pitt Creative 360 which provides marketing content for other clubs on campus.</p>
	<p>During the summer of 2018, I had an internship at the Dick's Sporting Goods Customer Support Center in Coraopolis, PA.  I spent my time in the Buying Department of NFL Licensed Apparel.  I have since accepted a full-time position back with Dick's and in September 2019, I will begin working there as a Merchandising Trainee. <a id="Skills"></a></p>

    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
   <p>In my Composing Digital Media class and in Pitt Creative 360, I created some content using Adobe Photoshop.  Below are some examples of my work that were required for class.</p>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1. An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience.</b></p>
	  <div class="ad"><img src="Movie.png" height="500" width="610"></div>
	  <p>For this movie poster, my partner and I changed the genre from Action to Comedy by adding red eyes, changing the cigarette to a joint, and changing the background color to a deeper green, as well as some other subtle changes.  If I had to change it to something else, I would probably change it from Action to Horror.  The dark purple painted face in the background provides a nice “villain” so I could simply darken the borders of the poster.  Then I would do something creepy like make Norton have jet-black eyes and cry blood.  This would give the viewer a very different assumption of whether or not they would enjoy the movie.  For an expert on Horror, I would also have to change the fonts, and the background blue-green color to something like red.  For someone who knew nothing about Horror, I think the crying blood would be sufficient to get the point across.</p>
	  
    <p><b>2. An example of how I made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode.</b></p>
    	  <div class="ad"><img src="Rocketry.jpg" alt="Rocketry Logo" height="500" width="550"></div>
	  <p>For this logo, I was working directly with a client.  They wanted bright colors, and specific text to be included.  To accommodate these requests, I made the fire a nice bright red, orange, yellow combination, and included all of their text.  I chose the font that I did because I thought it gave a scientific, digital, NASA vibe to the logo.  The all caps for “Pitt Rocketry” helps it to stand out, and the all lower case in the “per aruda ad astra” helps keep it subtle.  This latin phrase means “through adversity to the stars” and I thought that Cathy breaking through the border reflected this motto nicely.</p>
	  <p>The only real circumstances I had to follow were the specific requests of the Rocketry Club.  If they were to suggest something else, I would adjust accordingly.  For instance, if they wanted Pitt colors, I would change the border to navy, and the color of the earth to navy waters and dark gold land.</p>
	  
    <p><b>3. An example of how I made a choice related to comparing one thing to another.</b><p>
	  <div class="ad"><img src="PittPSU.jpg" alt="Pitt PSU" height="500" width="650"></div>
	  <p>The Pitt / Penn State rivalry game is one where almost every viewer, including myself, is biased towards one team or another.  The challenge with this was to be unbiased but keep the tension.  I tried to do this with a rough-edged paint brush around each coach, the dark night-view of Heinz Field, and the logos facing each other above the field.  </p>
	  <p>If I were to do it again or revise this piece, I would try to find better pictures of the coaches facing each other, and mess around more with some fine details of the paint brush tool to add some texture to it.  I think these 2 small changes would enhance the grit of the picture and make the game seem more intense.  I would also add a faded, dark border around the entire picture to symbolize the “tunnel vision” each team has on this game, even though it is 5 months away.</p>
	  
    <p><b>4. An example of something that frustrated me or took a larger amount of time than I would have liked.</b></p>
	  <div class="ad">
		  <img src="BirdPen.png" alt="Bird Pen Tool" height="400" width="810"></li>  
	  </div>
	  <p>The Pen Tool is one of the most useful tools in Photoshop for cutting out elements of an image cleanly and completely.  It is also very useful for creating custom shapes and separating elements of an image into separate layers.  It is an essential tool to learn if you want to differentiate yourself from a beginner to an intermediate photoshopper.  The above images are from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsSjXNOE7NM">PHLEARN YouTube tutorial</a> I followed.  The image on the left is the original, and I used the Pen Tool to cut out the bird and paste it onto the beach background.  It took me about 3-4 tries to get it done correctly.  The biggest learning curve is practicing how the line bends when you click and drag on a new anchor point.  Then once you have a change in direction, you have to adjust the back-end of the anchor point to accommodate for the new angle the curve will take.  Trial and error is the best way to learn the fine details of the Pen Tool.</p>
	  
    <p><b>5. An example of something I am particularly proud of.</b></p>
    	  <div class="ad"><img src="360.jpg" alt="Creative 360 Logo" height="500" width="550"></div>
	  <p>This is the logo that I created for the Pitt Creative 360 club.  The reason I am proud of this piece of work is because it has the potential to be implemented outside of the classroom.  If the club decides that my logo is sufficient, then this will be the first thing people see when they approach us to do creative work for them.  It would be an honor to have my creative work be the quintessential face of a creative organization.</p>
	  <p>In the future, I would like to create an alternate logo, similar to this one, where the letters “reative” are outside of the C, rather than inside of it.  This way we have options to use for a Facebook / Twitter header, or the top of a flier.  I want this to be something unique and aesthetically pleasing, but also adaptable and functional for a variety of uses.</p>
