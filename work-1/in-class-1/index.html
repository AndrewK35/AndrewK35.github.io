	  <p>The main thing I want to accomplish with my website is a good combination of a subtle color scheme, and an elegant font.  I think that when a website can combine these two elements, it makes the content seem more professional.  In my opinion, black and white is boring and looks undeveloped.  I want my header to be a dark, bold color.  I want my menu to be lighter and change color when the mouse hoovers over each selection.  I want my subhead to be dark text against a light-colored background and the content should match that color scheme.  The footer should mirror the header.  Even if I use Black and Silver and tones of Gray, I think it looks more elegant than plain black and white.  For instance, https://www.apple.com isn’t a bold color scheme, but it seems professional and respected.</p>
	  <p>As far as functionality, I love how the when you click the menu on http://essential.riccardoborchi.it it scrolls you to the appropriate part of the page.  I think since we have a lot of text content, having one long scroll would be a nice way to have someone read through all of it.  The menu is there as a directory to take you to the appropriate “chapter” per say.</p>
	  <p>I think that the website I am trying to build for this class is very audience-driven, in the fact that the content on it is class-specific.  The original purpose of the site is for a grade in Composing Digital Media, however, after the class is finished, I would like to add the website to my resume. My audience is clearly my professor, and any potential employer, who is reviewing my content for professionalism.  Since this content can be too “neat,” to spice it up a little, I would like to play with the margins and text size.  I think a larger text size will make the content seem longer.</p>
