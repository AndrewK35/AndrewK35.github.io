    <p>Andrew Kunselman attended Central Valley High School where he was born and raised in Aliquippa Pennsylvania.  He graduated in 2015 and enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh where he is a current Junior majoring in Marketing and Business Information Systems with a Certificate in Digital Media.    Andrew has also received his Google AdWords Certification in his spare time and has run two successful political online advertising campaigns.  One was a state-wide race in Pennsylvania, and one was in Beaver County. Andrew’s passion for sports and incredible networking capabilities have landed him a job as an Equipment Manager for the University of Pittsburgh Football team where he distributes and routinely fixes helmets, shoulder pads, and other equipment.  As an Equipment Manager he is also responsible for pre-game and post-game locker room set up and clean up, including traveling to away games, and providing laundry service for members of the team and staff.</p>

	  <p>Bills Mafia Broken Table For Sale</p>
	  <p>This table was personally body slammed by a die-hard member of the Bills Mafia.  It was a fully functioning Rubbermaid folding table during the tailgate prior to the game against the Dolphins on December 31, 2017.  After the win, Bills Mafia returned to the parking lot to celebrate and have a few drinks.  As we all know, Bills fans love smashing tables, so in perfect form, Gary Simmons took flight from the bed of his pickup truck and belly flopped onto the table.  It immediately broke in half and was then lit on fire.  Since this table is from the game that sent the Bills to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years, I am asking $200, or best offer.</p>
	  <p>If you are interested, please email me at BuffaloBillsMafia7@gmail.com. Go Bills!</p>
	  <p>PS – the video is on twitter, @BuffaloGary. Check it out.</p>
