	  <p>Bills Mafia Broken Table For Sale</p>
	  <img class= "bills" src="bills mafia table.png" alt="Bills Mafia Table">
	  <p>This table was personally body slammed by a die-hard member of the Bills Mafia.  It was a fully functioning Rubbermaid folding table during the tailgate prior to the game against the Dolphins on December 31, 2017.  After the win, Bills Mafia returned to the parking lot to celebrate and have a few drinks.  As we all know, Bills fans love smashing tables, so in perfect form, Gary Simmons took flight from the bed of his pickup truck and belly flopped onto the table.  It immediately broke in half and was then lit on fire.  Since this table is from the game that sent the Bills to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years, I am asking $200, or best offer.</p>
	  <p>If you are interested, please email me at BuffaloBillsMafia7@gmail.com. Go Bills!</p>
	  <p>PS â€“ the video is on twitter, @BuffaloGary. Check it out.</p>
