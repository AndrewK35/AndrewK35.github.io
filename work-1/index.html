    <h2>Work-in-Progress 1</h2>
	  <p>This course is the first time I have ever engaged with writing code on my own.  I had a very general idea of the theory behind a coder writing code, and browsers interpreting different tags to show the end user a website, but I had no previous knowledge of what each tag does and how to organize it all in a program like GitHub.</p>
	  <p>At first, I was following simple instructions in class to create a header, a menu, and skeleton links to all of the assignment submissions we will have throughout the course.  Looking around the classroom I noticed all of our websites looked very similar.  One day in class, we were asked to write about some of the design elements we wanted to incorporate to make our websites unique.  As I was searching for inspiration, I came across a blog from an Italian designer with an interesting method implemented to browse the site (http://essential.riccardoborchi.it/).  I later learned that this style is called "parallax" and it is trending in the industry right now.  I think this may be a challenge, considering my lack of experience in coding, but I am excited to give it a shot.  If I am able to successfully implement it, I think it will make my site appear very professional, considering the majority of the content is short-form text.</p>
	  <p>When thinking about a color scheme, I immediately thought of https://www.apple.com/ because I hold their site in high regard.  I think it is extremely clean-cut but comes off as trendy and advanced.  For this reason, I came up with a color palette to implement in my CSS styling.  I have a black header with white text, a dark gray menu with white text, a light silver background for the body with black text, and a black footer with white text to match the header.  I also have two shades of blue that I think complement the black and gray color scheme, but I haven't decided yet where I want to implement them.</p>
	  <p>The first actual change I made was to the font, because the default font makes a website seem underdeveloped in my opinion.  After googling some different options for CSS that are accepted by all major browsers, I came to the decision to implement the "Trebuchet MS" font.  I found it to be nice and simple, there weren't a lot of stylistic accents on the end of the letters, which made it easy to read.</p>
	  <p>Simply adding the color and font to the CSS was not enough to give my website a professional feel.  The header was thin and didn't touch the menu.  To fix this, I added 30px of padding and changed the margin to 0px.  This gave the header a bigger, bolder area of black and brought it in contact with the menu below.  The menu was too thin, and the options were too close together.  To fix this, I added 10px of padding and changed the display to "flex" and the justification to "space-around."  This made the menu an appropriate size in proportion to the header and spaced out the options equally according to the size of the screen.  When a user makes the screen smaller, the menu options adjust to the width and remain equally centered.  Finally, for a little bit of extra functionality, I added a hover style to the menu.  When a user hovers over a menu item, the background color changes to black, as opposed to the gray on the rest of the menu.</p>
	  <p>Most of my work was done during class time.  Conveniently, I also have group meetings for American Marketing Association on Tuesday nights after class.  These do not start until 9:30 and class ends at 8:30, so every week I spend my down time finishing up some details of my website.   This is when I normally google different things to mess around with and see how they work.  I used to do this all on GitHub, but I got impatient waiting for the changes to make their way through GitHub, and to my final site.  I recently copied and pasted my code into JSFiddle.net because it is much faster to type something in and press "Run" to see what effect it has through some quick trial and error.</p>
	  <p>In the immediate future, I want to implement a sticky menu, that keeps my menu bar available at the top of the page no matter how far users scroll down.  This will be extremely useful for anyone visiting my site, especially if I am able to execute the parallax style later on.  I also need to do some trial and error configuring the formatting of the "h2" and "p" tags to see what looks best.  I'm going to play with centering the h2 as opposed to having it left aligned.  I also might make it slightly larger and apply one of the blue colors from the color palette.  Finally, I am going to play with some different margins for the paragraph text to try to center it more and change some of the alignment coding to make it adjust to the width of the screen, similar to the menu bar.</p>
