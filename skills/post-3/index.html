	  <p>Picking up where I left off, I kept spending time creating quick logo ideas for the Rocketry Club using Photoshop.  The members of Creative 360 are very honest with their opinions and everything you send to the group is judged harshly.  
		  This is a good thing in my opinion, because it forces us to create high quality work.  However, because of these high standards, many of my ideas were shut down.  The president of Creative 360 also wanted to recruit new members to our club.
		  She told me to take a break from the Rocketry Logo and try to come up with a flier for ourselves that was attention-catching, informative, and inviting.  I came up with two quick ideas and sent them her way.  
		  They will be voted on in the future.</p>
	  <p>At this point, I needed some inspiration to get back into the Rocketry Logo design.  I decided to watch bits and pieces of the Lynda video on Logo Design Techniques.  This video in its entirety was over 4 hours long. I decided to 
		  look ahead at each of the sections and pick and choose which ones would be helpful for my project.</p>
	  <p>After watching the video, and receiving some advice from the members of Creative 360, I designed a logo that I am really proud of.  The basic idea is to have the Cathedral of Learning blasting off from Earth like a rocket and the entire
		  image is enclosed in a circle where we put the club name and slogan.  I have a meeting with Creative 360 on March 1st where we will discuss whether or not this will be our final logo design.</p>
	  <p>In the down time between my design and the meeting, I decided to watch some YouTube videos to sharpen some of my Photoshop skills.  I found a page called PHLEARN "that makes learning Photoshop and Photography easy and fun."  In my opinion,
		  these short-form videos with excellent examples are much easier to learn from and try on your own.  Some of the most useful videos were on Custom Shapes and the Pen Tool.  These tools are extremely versatile and can be used in a variety of
		  ways for a large range of projects.  One of the videos was about creating Billboard advertisements using Smart Objects.  I have yet to try this out on my own, but I love the
		  concept, because it allows a marketer to show his client exactly how the billboard will look in the specified location by inserting the design into a photo of the desired billboard.</p>
	  <p>In addition to the Rocketry Logo, our club, Pitt Creative 360, needs its own new logo.  I had a little bit of down time between classes and meetings so I threw together two quick ideas that will be discussed in the meeting on March 1st at 6PM.</p>
