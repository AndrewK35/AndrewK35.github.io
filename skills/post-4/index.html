	  <p>My original area of focus for the Skills Assignment was "Photoshop for Print Ads."  I quickly changed this focus towards Logo Design and social media content, because of a club I joined shortly after the start of this assignment.  I began my 20 hours of self-practice by watching a Lynda video about Advertising Campaigns and how they tell a story.  This video was short, only 35 minutes, but covered a lot of good material about what kinds of ads elicit a response from a customer and which ones don't.  They said if you leave your story-telling ad open ended, customers will want to finish the story themselves by making a transaction.  This was good information for the advertising industry, but it didn't teach me anything about Photoshop, and I was eager to get started.</p>
	  <p>Using what we learned in class, and a little bit of background knowledge from a high school class, I began my own project.  I wanted to merge the Pittsburgh and London skylines, because I am from Pittsburgh and I studied abroad in London in the summer of 2017.  Since London doesn't have a defined skyline, I decided to choose a picture of Big Ben, and put some famous Pittsburgh skyscrapers behind it.  The challenge here was to create a sunset effect on the Pittsburgh buildings that matched the sunset in the original Big Ben picture.  I had to play around with the hue and saturation of the colors in each individual building to get it to look right.  It was just an amateur attempt at the overall idea, but I was proud of it and I showed all my roommates.  They said it looked good and suggested I do something for the football team (since all 5 of us work there).</p>
	  <p>From there I decided to make a graphic of Coach Narduzzi and Coach Franklin in clouds of smoke above Heinz Field for the Pitt/Penn State rivalry game coming up this season.  I thought this would be interesting because more and more, sports marketers are using graphics like this on social media and online advertisements, which is what I want to do after graduation.  I practiced using the magic wand tool and quick-selection tool to cut out the coaches from their original pictures.  From there, I practiced with layers and the paint tool to make some of the cloud appear in front of them, and some of it appear behind them, giving it the effect that each coach was emerging from their cloud.  Sadly, I ran out of time before class and had to leave this project unfinished.</p>
	  <p>At this point, I had joined a club on campus called Pitt Creative 360 that makes logos, fliers, and other content for organizations on campus or non-profits that cannot afford to pay anyone to do it for them.  This way, we get the experience and the organization gets some great content for free.  I was thrilled to find this club, because it fits my interests perfectly.  This organization brought a lot of projects for me to work on too.  I was immediately faced with the challenge of creating a logo for the Rocketry club here at Pitt, creating a new logo for ourselves, and creating a flier for our club to attract new members.  I tried to make a few designs on my own at first, but I was struggling to come up with ideas, so I watched another Lynda video.  This one was about Logo Design, but it was based on Adobe Illustrator, which I have no experience with.  It was also quite lengthy and dry which made it difficult to pay attention to.</p>
	  <p>Because of this, I turned to YouTube to find some quicker, more engaging videos to teach myself some easy, useful Photoshop skills.  This is where I found PHLEARN, an organization that provides Photoshop and Photography lessons available online.  Each video is 10-20 minutes long and takes you through an example that you can easily follow along with.  I started off simple, watching videos like "How to Create Custom Shapes" and "How to Use the Pen Tool."  I used the general videos to learn skills I could apply to these Creative 360 projects, like the Rocketry Logo.  I created about 4 or 5 logo concepts, but our club only meets once a week, so it takes a while to get feedback on them.</p>
	  <p>When I wasn't working on Creative 360 logos and fliers, I used PHLEARN to do tutorials like "How to Create a Social Media Banner" and "How to Make a Billboard Advertisement."  These videos were more relevant to my original goal and gave me lots of ideas for practice projects to work on.  I learned how to create a smart object, fit it to a photo of a billboard, and then edit that smart object to create my own ad and have it display on the original billboard.  This is extremely useful when creating billboard ads for a client because you can show them how it will look once it is published.  I was excited to learn something I could use in the real world so quickly and easily.  The same technique can be used for pasting a fake screen image on a photo of someone using an iPad, and I did some practice with that as well.</p>
	  <p>I took some time off for Spring Break, but I have another Creative 360 meeting coming up this week, so to refresh myself I watched a PHLEARN videos about mastering the Pen Tool, because it is so useful for cutting out objects in Photoshop with much more precision.  Afterwards, I was looking for some inspiration for one or two final projects to finish up my 20 hours, so I watched videos on "How to Make an Album Cover" and "How to Make a Magazine Cover."  I decided to try the magazine cover, but I had little success because the photo I wanted to use on the cover was too small for an 8.5 x 11 format, so when I enlarged it, the photo became very pixelated.  I decided to change it up and make another social media graphic using some of the text-alignment skills that I learned in the video.</p>
	  <p>In the process of failing to create the magazine cover, I had an idea for a Creative 360 logo, so I finished up my attempt at the magazine and switched gears.  I then went in and created a logo for Pitt Creative 360 that I sent to the group chat and got very positive feedback on.  The next meeting is this Thursday (March 15) and that's when I hope to get group approval of the Creative 360 logo and maybe tweak the colors a little bit to finalize that overall design, and I also hope to hear back from the Rocketry Club and go further on that project.</p>
	  <p>Almost all of my work towards the 20 hour goal was done in the library, because I do not have Photoshop installed on my laptop so I had to use the University computer labs.  Because I was in this setting, I wore headphones for the entirety of the 20 hours.  Sometimes I would listen to a podcast, but mostly it was a variety of music to drown out the sound of the chatter in Hillman.</p>
	  <p>I began this assignment wanting to focus on print ads because I thought that would be the most relevant medium for Photoshop, but in the process, I fell in love with Logo Design and learned that Photoshop is also commonly used for social media and digital advertising, which is where my true interest lies.  I definitely found a new passion in Photoshop during this experience and I can't wait to see what else I can do with it through Pitt Creative 360.</p>
	  <p>If I had to do it again, I would skip the Lynda videos and go straight to YouTube.  The shorter videos gave me quick lessons and allowed me to think of small projects to practice those skills on.  The Lynda videos were too long and taught me 5-6 skills that I could not apply immediately.   Going slower, skill by skill, I was able to really get the hang of a few key things rather than getting a general idea of a ton of different features.</p>
