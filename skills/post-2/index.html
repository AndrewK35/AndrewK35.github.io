	  <p>I started off by watching a Lynda Video about how Advertising Campaigns need to tell a story, but not always the whole story.  If you leave it open-ended, the customer will want to finish it on their own.
		  for instance, if you generate the need to purchase a product, and justify that need, but omit the character actually buying the product, the customer will feel the need to finish the story and purchase the product on their own.</p>
	  <p>After watching this video, I felt the need to get some more hands-on practice with Photoshop and some of its features.  My first project I came up with was to incorporate some of the elements of the Pittsburgh skyline into an image of London, because I
		  am from Pittsburgh, and studied abroad in London over the summer.  This place would be my ideal city.  I put the Cathedral of Learning, the Highmark Building, PPG Building, U.S. Steel Building, One Oxford Center, and BNY Mellon Building behind an image of Big Ben.
		  This gave me a lot of practice with cutting an element out of its overall image, using the Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools.  Once I pasted them into the Big Ben picture, I had to alter some of their color attributes to create a slight sunset effect. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome, given my level of experience.</p>
	  <p>My next thought was to make a graphic for the Pitt-PSU rivalry football game coming up this fall.  I wanted to create the effect of both head coaches coming out of a cloud of smoke the color of their respective teams.  Again I had to cut the coaches out of a separate image, and this time I had to create
		  Layers of smoke so that some of it was in front of the coach, and some of it was behind them.  I did not get very far with this project before joining Creative 360 and acquiring some assigned work.</p>
	  <p>On February 22nd, I joined a club at Pitt called Creative 360.  This club is a student-run consulting group that creates logos, fliers, websites, etc. for other groups on campus who do not have the in-house expertise, or cannot afford to pay someone for this work.  My first project was to create a logo for the Pitt Rocketry Club.
		  The president of this club had many requirements for his new logo, including bright colors, their slogan, and a subtle Pitt reference.  At this point, my job was to create a couple of different templates to get a feel for what he liked and disliked and then we would create a finalized logo soon after.  This is still a work in progress.</p>
