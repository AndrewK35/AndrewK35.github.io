    <p><b>1. An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience.</b></p>
	  <div class="ad"><img src="Movie.png" height="500" width="610"></div>
	  <p>For this movie poster, my partner and I changed the genre from Action to Comedy by adding red eyes, changing the cigarette to a joint, and changing the background color to a deeper green, as well as some other subtle changes.  If I had to change it to something else, I would probably change it from Action to Horror.  The dark purple painted face in the background provides a nice “villain” so I could simply darken the borders of the poster.  Then I would do something creepy like make Norton have jet-black eyes and cry blood.  This would give the viewer a very different assumption of whether or not they would enjoy the movie.  For an expert on Horror, I would also have to change the fonts, and the background blue-green color to something like red.  For someone who knew nothing about Horror, I think the crying blood would be sufficient to get the point across.</p>
	  
    <p><b>2. An example of how I made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode.</b></p>
    	  <div class="ad"><img src="Rocketry.jpg" alt="Rocketry Logo" height="500" width="500"></div>
	  <p>For this logo, I was working directly with a client.  They wanted bright colors, and specific text to be included.  To accommodate these requests, I made the fire a nice bright red, orange, yellow combination, and included all of their text.  I chose the font that I did because I thought it gave a scientific, digital, NASA vibe to the logo.  The all caps for “Pitt Rocketry” helps it to stand out, and the all lower case in the “per aruda ad astra” helps keep it subtle.  This latin phrase means “through adversity to the stars” and I thought that Cathy breaking through the border reflected this motto nicely.</p>
	  <p>The only real circumstances I had to follow were the specific requests of the Rocketry Club.  If they were to suggest something else, I would adjust accordingly.  For instance, if they wanted Pitt colors, I would change the border to navy, and the color of the earth to navy waters and dark gold land.</p>
	  
    <p><b>3. An example of how I made a choice related to comparing one thing to another.</b><p>
	  
    <p><b>4. An example of something that frustrated me or took a larger amount of time than I would have liked.</b></p>
	  <div class="ad">
		  <img src="BirdPen.png" alt="Bird Pen Tool" height="400" width="810"></li>  
	  </div>
	  <p>The Pen Tool is one of the most useful tools in Photoshop for cutting out elements of an image cleanly and completely.  It is also very useful for creating custom shapes and separating elements of an image into separate layers.  It is an essential tool to learn if you want to differentiate yourself from a beginner to an intermediate photoshopper.  The above images are from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WJj6iNr6K0">PHLEARN YouTube tutorial</a> I followed.  The image on the left is the original, and I used the Pen Tool to cut out the bird and paste it onto the beach background.  It took me about 3-4 tries to get it done correctly.  The biggest learning curve is practicing how the line bends when you click and drag on a new anchor point.  Then once you have a change in direction, you have to adjust the back-end of the anchor point to accommodate for the new angle the curve will take.  Trial and error is the best way to learn the fine details of the Pen Tool.</p>
