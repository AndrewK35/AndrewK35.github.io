    <p>The assignment in class was intended to give us some introductory practice with some of the tools in Photoshop.  We were given a set of old print advertisements and we were told to change them to advertise for something else.  I found this Tektronix ad and thought it would be fun to mess with the images on the screen.</p>

<p>I had recently discussed the Twitter acquisition and deletion of the Vine application with friends, and we were talking about how much we missed watching the hilarious 6-second videos that Vine provided us.  Combining this discussion with the above advertisement, I thought it would be funny to make the computer into a Vine Time Machine.</p>

	  <p>To do this, I basically selected the paint brush tool, and matched the color to the existing white background as best as I could.  Then I colored over top of the entire ad copy, and used the text tool to write in my own copy.  From there all I had to do was select and delete the original screen, and insert the picture of Peanut Butter Baby in a layer behind the ad.</p>
