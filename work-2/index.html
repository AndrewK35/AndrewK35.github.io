    <p>The first change I made since my last Work-In-Progress submission, was to add a professional headshot of myself to the About Me section.  I thought that section was a little boring to be the home page, so the headshot adds some content.  I thought the circular shape would be more elegant than a sharp square image.  I put a border on it in order to add some of the blue color to the dark gray and black overall scheme.  Lastly, I edited the About Me content from third person to first person, because I felt like it made more sense under my headshot and I added some more content about myself. After the changes to the About Me section, I also added a photo to In Class Assignment 1 and edited the In Class Assignment 2 text content.</p>
    <p>When I was done revising old text content, I decided to change the active link color to the same blue as my headshot border.  I implemented the active link feature for both the main header and the sub-head.  Then, I changed the hover color to a lighter blue which complements the color scheme overall.  The hover color also overrides the active color, so that users can still tell when they hover over the active link.</p>
    <p>My third change to the site was to add some personal information to my footer, including a working email link that opens up a blank email directed to my Pitt account. Users can fill in their own content and contact me directly with the click of a button.</p>
    <p>After editing the footer, it made sense to me to edit the header.  The only edit I made was to enable the h1 to link to the home page, since most users are accustomed to this feature from other websites.</p>
    <p>Once I was satisfied with the look of the website, I decided to experiment with the functionality of it.  I mentioned in previous assignments that I wanted to implement parallax scrolling, which requires JavaScript, so I decided to try and teach myself a little bit.  The first step was to move every sub-section of my site to the main page.  I simply copied and pasted the code sequentially below the About Me section.</p>
    <p>The next step was to enable the links in the header to send the user downward, rather than to a different page.  To do this, I tagged each subhead with the “name=” code and then changed the links in the header to link to the respective names.  I would like to make this a smooth scroll in the future, using JavaScript, but for now it is done using html and tags.</p>
    <p>After I got those links to scroll the user rather than navigate them, I had to make a Sticky NavBar so that the user still had access to it all the way at the bottom of the page.  This was my first encounter with JavaScript.  I looked up a few different videos and articles on how to implement this, but I had trouble connecting a JavaScript file to my main index.html file.  Interestingly enough, I figured out how to insert the JavaScript code at the bottom of my html code and it worked the way I wanted it to.</p>
    <p>The NavBar now sticks to the top, but when the user scrolls far enough for it to stick, there is a slight jump on the page because of the missing space where the NavBar used to be.  I still need to figure out how to fix this, but I would like to do so in a JavaScript file, not at the bottom of my html.  Further, the sticky NavBar covers up my h2 when the link scrolls the user down to it.  I need to figure out how to make the links scroll just above the h2, while keeping the sticky NavBar in a good spot.  This, again, will require JavaScript which I would like to spend some more time figuring out.</p>
    <p>The final thing I want to figure out how to do is change through sub-menu items while staying on the same page.  For instance, if a user clicks WIP2 on the main menu, and is sent down here, and then clicks Photoshop Revision, I want everything else to stay the same, but have the WIP2 section change from Written Reflection to Photoshop Revision.  I believe this is possible through JavaScript, but again, it will take some self-teaching to figure that out.</p>
