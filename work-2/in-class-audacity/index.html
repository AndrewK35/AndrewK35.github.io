    <p>My group's topic was an "over crowded mind" and since we did this project around mid-terms, my first thought was to emulate the noise that is created by everyone in the library.  We discussed in class how the topic is ironic because the library is a place that is intended to be quiet, and it is often quite noisy.  It is also ironic because I often go there to escape distractions, and end up walking into a building full of them.</p>
    <p>We also discussed a lot of ways I can go further with this, since it is pretty straight-forward as-is.  Some of the ideas included adding specific characters, or at least specific voices in the library that are particularly annoying, adding repetition or a building effect with some of the sounds to create a feeling of anxiety, and most importantly making the audience feel frustrated, even though the library doesn't make everyone frustrated the way it does for me.</p>
